# Postgres over REST service

The *Postgres over REST* service provides a simple web api to query Postgres/Redshift data warehouses. This project includes the following:

* A docker container that includes test data.  Go to the docker-pg-server folder where you will find a README file with additional directions
* A node server that provides the REST api to query your local Postgres instance.  You can adjust its config.json file to query different instances.  Refer to its README file for directions on how to start the node server.

## Security
This service does not attempt to provide authentication or authorization functionality.  Please use a security product such as Cognito to provide such services.

## How to test
Using ChartFactor Studio, you can use the Redshift provider and URL http://127.0.0.1:3000" to visualize your data files.
